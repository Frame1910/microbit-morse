# Micro:morse
Micro:morse is a python based Morse code translator that is in development for a project. The planned features of this script are by order of priority:

**Bold = Completed but could still be changed**
<br>
_Italics = Initiated development_
<br>
~~Strikethrough = Development cancelled~~

- **Translate between Morse code and English**
- **Have either function be called at will by the user**
- **Transmit the translated data over radio using Micro:bits**
- **Input message data into the Micro:bit via a terminal interface on a computer/laptop**
- Allow users to have a conversation over this communication method, this includes:
  - ~~Sending a message at will~~
  - ~~Being able to receive a message at any time from someone else~~
  - _Two way conversation, with both parties having the same code being executed on each one of their Micro:bits_

## Usage
In order to test this yourself, you need to download the repository, unzip it, then run it from the project root in command line/terminal. Python 3.x is needed to run most of the scripts.
**Note: Any scripts in the "Mu" file directory will not run on anything besides a Micro:bit as those files use MicroPython, not standard Python.**

## Documentation
This project is being developed on Atom by GitHub using Python as the primary language.
