# Micro:morse
Micro:morse is a python based Morse code translator that I built for a Computer Science Assessment using Micro:bits.

## Usage
Run one of the scripts, depending on what module you want to use. Currently, modules are in seperate files for testing purposes. Once finished, I will move all the code to one file where it can be executed by Micro:bits.

## Documentation
Documentation including detailed planning can be found on the Google Doc found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YJrq8PJzLuS7DwwlR7GVcPPCk7Op0qMsjf26sREFu0M/edit?usp=sharing).
