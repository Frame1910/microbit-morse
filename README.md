# Micro:morse
Micro:morse is a python based Morse code translator that is in development for a project. The planned features of this script are by order of priority:

**Bold = Completed but could still be changed**
_Italics = Initiated development_

- **Translate between Morse code and English**
- **Have either function be called at will by the user**
- _Transmit the translated data over radio using Micro:bits_
- Input message data into the Micro:bit via a mobile phone interface (Micro:bit app)
- Allow users to have a conversation over this communication method, this includes:
  - Sending a message at will
  - Being able to receive a message at any time from someone else
  - Two way conversation, with both parties having the same code being executed on each one of their Micro:bits

## Usage
In order to test this yourself, you need to download the repository, unzip it, then run it from the project root in command line/terminal. Python 3.x is needed to run most of the scripts.
**Note: Any scripts in the "Mu" file directory will not run on anything besides a Micro:bit as those files use MicroPython, not standard Python.**
